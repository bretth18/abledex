# abledex

a macos application for indexing, organizing, tracking, browsing and managing ableton projects + sets across filesystems. 

## Info

abledex was created as a solution to a problem i've created for myself over the years: i'm incredibly disorganized when it comes to naming, organizing and tracking my ableton projects and sets. i have numerous ableton projects with random keyboard smashed titles, copied over files from external drives with incorrect dates, and generally a mess of files scattered across multiple drives. abledex aims to solve this problem by providing a centralized application to index, organize, track, browse and manage ableton projects + sets across filesystems.

instead of spending hours trying to remember what that really good half-finished track you made in 2018 is actually called, where it's located, and what version it is, abledex allows you to quickly search, filter and sort through your ableton projects + sets with ease.


built with swift and swiftUI, abledex provides a familiar interface for macOS users.
